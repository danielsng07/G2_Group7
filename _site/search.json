We will be using the availability of information such as locations visited by the employees and credit cards usage to discover suspicious activities.\r\nProject Objectives\r\nThe project aims to deliver an R-Shiny App that provides: 1. Interactive user interface to allow users on selection of key parameters (such as Car ID, card number, vendor name) to discover visited locations and card spending patterns. 2. Visual map representation of the vehicle movement and popular locations 3. Relationship discovery among GASTech personnel 4. Indicators of suspicious activities via key findings\r\nData Description\r\nData is from VAST Challenge 2021 and can be downloaded from VAST Challenge 2021: Mini-Challenge 2.\r\nThe Data packages provided includes the following\r\nESRI shapefiles of Abila and Kronos\r\nA tourist map of Abila with locations of interest identified, in JPEG format (MC2-Tourist.jpg)\r\ncar-assignments.csv, gps.csv, loyalty_data.csv, cc_data.csv.\r\nThe breakdown of the data type for the csv files are as follow.\r\n\r\nProposed Scope and Methodology\r\nData Preparation In R\r\nConducting Exploratory Data Analysis in R\r\nVisualising and Analysing Time-Oriented Data\r\nVisualising Geographical Data and conducting Geospatial Analysis in R\r\nUsing R Shiny to build web-enabled application\r\nStoryboard & Visualization Features\r\nProject Timeline & Deliverables\r\nKey deliverables as part of our project would include the below:\r\nProject Website\r\nProject Github\r\nR Shiny web application\r\nResearch paper\r\nPoster\r\nProject artifacts\r\n\r\nSoftware Tools\r\nRStudio\r\nR Packages\r\nshiny\r\ntidyverse\r\ntmap\r\nDT\r\nplotly\r\nggplot2\r\nTeam Members\r\nAmrita Mishra\r\nSng Kah Leong\r\nReferences\r\nModern R with the tidyverse by Bruno Rodrigues\r\nBrendan R.
